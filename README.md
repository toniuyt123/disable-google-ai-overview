# Disable Google AI Overviews

## Overview

Disable Google AI Overviews is a chrome extension that removes Google's AI overviews. Although there are already similar extensions I found that they just visually hide the AI overview by editing the page after it's loaded. This extension prevents the AI overview one step earlier by appending "-ai" to every browser search you make which forces Google to not give you an AI overview.
This has the added benefit of not wasting compute recourses which is both faster and more environmentally friendly.

## Suitable for

- People who generally search more complex information which AI interviews often get wrong.
- People who want to avoid AI due to environmental concerns.
- People who don't like AI overviews in Google search results.
- People who harbor anti-AI sentiments.

## Usage

Just install and enjoy AI free googling. Turn on/off from extensions menu.
